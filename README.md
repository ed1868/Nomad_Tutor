# Prompt Format

The pricing and limitations of the OpenAI API are predicated on the number of [Tokens](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) utilized. In essence, the greater the volume of tokens that are sent and received, the more quickly the API limits will be reached and the higher the associated costs will be.

_If you are using the ChatGPT web interface, the costs will not apply (API USE ONLY)._

|Format|Tokens|Reduction from JSON format|
